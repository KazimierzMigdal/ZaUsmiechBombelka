# ZaUsmiechBombelka
ZaUsmiechBombekla - contains source files of the authored project written in Django. After creating an account on the portal, 
users can publish pictures of products (in this case children's clothes), browse products published by others and contact each
other to buy/sell them.   

The project also includes a commenting section of the blog and a user activity tracking section.
